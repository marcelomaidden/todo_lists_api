<p>
  Todo lists API is a backend project build with Ruby on Rails that allows users to create users, login using JWT token, creating tasks and add notes to the tasks.</p>
<p>
  After authenticating the user with e-mail and password, a JWT token is generated and this is used to authenticate the requests to all endpoints in the application.
</p>
<p>
  Users are only allowed to see their own tasks and notes, and their own profile information.
